## How to develop

## Creating an Issue
Before you create a new issue:
  * Check the [issues](https://github.com/commercetools/nodejs-boilerplate/issues) on Github to ensure that one doesn't already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue, there is an [ISSUE_TEMPLATE](https://github.com/commercetools/nodejs-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) to guide you.
  * Add the necessary labels to your issue.

## Committing/ submitting PRs

## Branching
  When creating a branch. Use the issue number(without the '#') as the prefix and add a short title. e.g

  ```
    45-add-oauth2-flow
  ```

## Readme
  Please check the readme template file for format and guidelines to creating readme for your project.

## Tests
  We use [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) for unit and integration test. You can use [Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) for acceptance tests.

  We try to maintain a code coverage of 100%. Please ensure you do so too ðŸ˜‰
